Simple example of using [centrifuge-mobile](https://github.com/centrifugal/centrifuge-mobile) library for iOS development.

You need to download library build for iOS from [releases page](https://github.com/centrifugal/centrifuge-mobile/releases).

After unpacking drag `Centrifuge.framework` to your application workspace and you are ready to use library.

Look at example in this repo to get basic understanding of how to use library.

Don't forget to run Centrifuge-based server (or Centrifugo). And also change connection address in example to yours if needed.
